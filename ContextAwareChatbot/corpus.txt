Customer churn refers to the loss of customers or clients who stop doing business with a company or service.
It is a key metric for companies in subscription-based industries such as telecom, SaaS, and streaming services.
Common reasons for churn include high prices, poor customer service, lack of value, and better offers from competitors.
Churn can be voluntary (customer chooses to leave) or involuntary (due to failed payments, etc).
Customer retention strategies include loyalty programs, personalized offers, proactive support, and satisfaction surveys.
In the telecom industry, predicting churn allows companies to take preventive actions before the customer leaves.
Machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost are commonly used to build churn prediction systems.
These models use features like tenure, monthly charges, contract type, internet service, and customer support calls.
One popular dataset for churn modeling is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which includes features like gender, contract type, and payment method.
Churn rate is calculated as: (Number of customers lost in a period / Total customers at the start) * 100.
Reducing churn improves lifetime value (LTV), profitability, and customer satisfaction.
It is cheaper to retain an existing customer than to acquire a new one.
Predictive churn models must be updated regularly as customer behavior patterns change over time.
Explainable AI (XAI) tools like SHAP or LIME can help interpret the predictions of black-box churn models.
Integrating churn prediction into CRM systems enables targeted marketing campaigns and better decision-making.
